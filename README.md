# NBA Shot Prediction using Machine Learning (XGBoost) #

The provided Python script utilizes data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques to gain insights into individual NBA players' shot selection, using data on Kobe Bryant as an example. The code begins by performing exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques to analyze various aspects of Kobe Bryant's shots, including shot make distribution, location, time, period analysis, clutch time, performance analysis, and shot type analysis.

In addition to data exploration, the code employs XGBoost, a powerful machine learning algorithm, for predictive modeling. It preprocesses the data, selects relevant features, and splits it into training and testing sets. The XGBoost classifier is then trained on the training set and used to predict shot outcomes on the testing set. The model's accuracy is evaluated by comparing the predicted labels with the actual labels.

By integrating machine learning with data exploration, the script provides a holistic approach to understanding Kobe Bryant's shot selection. It allows for both descriptive analysis through visualizations and predictive modeling using XGBoost, enabling the identification of important factors contributing to shot success.

Please note this script assumes the availability of the dataset (which is freely available for download online) in order to run effectively.  

Finally, big thank you to Seungjae Yeom for his help with this script-- Particularly in offering guidance during the EDA portion.
